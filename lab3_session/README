DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
------------------------

There is a leading directory and a directory for each exercise
There is a common Makefile in the leading directory and an specific Makefile in the directory of each exercise

LEADING MAKEFILE
------------------
It assumes that all the applications are formed by only one source file
It can generate 5 different versions of the executable file:

name	 -> Normal 
name.3	 -> Optimized  (option -O3, by default)
name.pg  -> Profiling  (option -pg)
name.pg3 -> Profiling  (option -pg, option -O3)
name.g	 -> Debug info (option -g)
name.pca -> PCA options
etc.

Rules:

cleanall: -> (you have to be in the same directory where the file is located). It does "make clean" of all subdirectories 
zip:      -> It makes a zip containing all the source files of all directories.

SPECIFIC MAKEFILES
--------------------
All include the leading Makefile
All of them allow the addition of specific compilation and/or linking options for the program

It inherits rules from the leading Makefile to build executable files
It inherits the "clean" rule -> To delete object/executable/core/... files from the current directory

PROGRAMS
---------
Most of the programs write their results to the stdout. 
Some of the programs write raw data... you need to redirect the stdout.
Almost all programs admit one parameter. It indicates the number of iterations that will do its innermost loop.
